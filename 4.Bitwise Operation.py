# We create a 300x300 pixel image filled with zeros (black).

# Explanation of the Code
# Creating the Base Images: We start by creating two black images (300x300 pixels) using np.zeros. This will serve as a background.

# Drawing Shapes: We draw a white rectangle on image1 and a white circle on image2. These shapes help us see the effects of bitwise operations.

# Bitwise Operations:

# Bitwise AND: Keeps only the area where both shapes overlap. Both pixels need to be white for this to appear white in the result.
# Bitwise OR: Combines the white areas of both images. Any pixel thatâ€™s white in either image will be white in the result.
# Bitwise XOR: Keeps only the non-overlapping areas, creating a boundary effect.
# Bitwise NOT: Inverts colors for each image individually. Black areas become white, and white areas become black.
# Each operation shows a different way of combining or modifying the images.
